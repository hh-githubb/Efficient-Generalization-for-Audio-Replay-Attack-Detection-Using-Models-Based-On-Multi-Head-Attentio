# Efficient-Generalization-for-Audio-Replay-Attack-Detection-Using-Models-Based-On-Multi-Head-Attentio
machine learning and deep learning based models for Audio Replay attack detection
# audio replay attack detection with CNN+Vision transformer

we can use cnn-vit model in end to end approach or use for feature extraction and then applay a machine learning model in back-end.
our proposed machine learning approacheas are:1-GMM 2-Svm 3-Logistic Regresion 4-Desicion Tree 5-K nearest neighbourhood 6-Adaboost 7-Random Forest 8-Light GBM
